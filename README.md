# MyFi.py
MyFi uses the power of pinging IP addresses in Wi-Fi subnets to detect how many people are in a certain location. In fact, it allows you to ping across the entire network to the other side of your college campus! Now you can know how packed a lecture hall or the party down the street is from the comfort of your own room.
Check [the website](https://ryanhoque.github.io/MyFi/) for a heatmap of all populations! Users of our script upload data to an online database via FireBase API and the website pulls that data and displays it with Google Maps API.
